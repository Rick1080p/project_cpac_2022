# Abstract
Machine Learning-based data sonification system to map data to music and generate a "data experience".
The data will be related to social/environmental issues in big italian cities.

## Artistic vision
We aim to raise awareness and educate the highest number of people possible, in particular:
- to educate the young generations
- to attract the elder
- to get detached people closer and interested in today's issues
- to reach the maximum level of inclusiveness

So that data comes through feelings and can be better understood without having to know specfic concepts. We wish to make the users feel the evolution of data through time and hear the impact of data through emotion.
Also to make a piece of art using the latest technology available.
Moreover we want to make a system that can be extended from both geographical scope and dataset type.

## Prototype after the hackathon
- Map by hand music to data
  - Use of a sample dataset
  - Use of SuperCollider or Python for music generation mapping directly data to sound (for example if the data gets worse, music chords become darker)
- Generate visuals based on data
  - Use of Processing mapping directly data to visual properties (particles, shapes, colors)
- Basic GUI

# Final project
- Build an audio file with music based on data using a conditional GAN
  - Computational scheme:

- Build a video support using Processing/ML/Image Processing
- Build a website as a platform where to reach the project and select the input city/data
